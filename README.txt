My first arduino based light-aware robot.

The goal is to produce a system of differential equations to control the robots behavior based on input from three photoresistors. this project is a proof of concept/ attempt to learn more about Arduino programming. It is tangental to my larger project of produceing systems for sensory augmentation and/or substitution.

The Robot in its current form uses an Arduino UNO and LadyADA motorshield. The photoresistors are located in the center and left and right of the robot. The motor base is a reused cheap rc car with left and right rear motor controls. Becuase of the motor configuration, one motor runs forward and the other in reverse to move the robot in straight line.
